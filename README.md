# SpaceBattle
<p> This is my first ever pygame! I made a space shooter game where the object of the game is to defeat all incoming enemy ships. 
There is a main menu, an options menu, a credits menu, an instructions tutorial and a button to start the game. 
All the code can be found in SpaceBattle.py </p>

## Start Menu
The start menu can be controlled using the arrow keys or the mouse. The menu item will turn blue when the menu arrow is pointing to it

## Options

There is only one page for the options of the game. The top half of the page informs the user player of all keyboard shortcuts, such as pause and unpause.
The bottom half allows a user player to pick the background music in the game.
