# SpaceBattle
<p> This is my first ever pygame! I made a space shooter game where the object of the game is to defeat all incoming enemy ships. 
There is a main menu, an options menu, a credits menu, an instructions tutorial and a button to start the game. 
All the code can be found in SpaceBattle.py </p>
