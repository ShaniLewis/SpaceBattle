# SpaceBattle
This is my first ever pygame! I made a space shooter game where the object of the game is to defeat all incoming enemy ships. 
There is a main menu, an options menu, a credits menu, an instructions tutorial and a button to start the game. 
All the code can be found in SpaceBattle.py


## Start Menu
The start menu can be controlled using arrow keys or the mouse and will highlight blue when directed to

## Options

There is only one page for the options of the game. The top half of the page informs the user of all keyboard shortcuts, such as pause and unpause.
The bottom half allows a user to pick the background music in the game.

## Level 4

The boss enemy ship comes down at speed 4 and moves around in a T formation trying to shoot the user player. On either side of the boss enemy, 
small enemy ships come down in pairs of two and try to shoot and get past the player.
